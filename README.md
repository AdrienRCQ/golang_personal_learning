# golang_personal_learning
This is my golang scripts in golang which done myself to improve my dev skills

## I] Hello World !
To begin my adventure with golang I started with the classic print hello world !
It wasn't hard, it taught my how is structure a Go file and how to execute it.

## II] Detect Linux Os Version :
Now we are going to check the version of our os (Linux). for that I used 3 interesting things : a map to store data from the os-release file.
I also read the content of this famous file : os-release.

## III] Monitoring resources :
After the basics, I'm going to handle the notions of packages and librairies. For that, I'm going to chek the 
resources usage by using a public lib called gopsutil.
I can now monitor CPU, RAM and Disk Usage.
